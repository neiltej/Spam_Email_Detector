# Spam_Email_Detector

Spam emails such as phishing and advertisements cost businesses and individuals millions of dollars annually. 

There are several techniques to automatically detect spam emails, although none of them have showed 100% predictive accuracy. 

Among all proposed models, machine learning and deep learning algorithms have achieved better accuracy. 

We have used Natural Language Processing including stopwords removal, stemming and ascii character removal to improve the accuracy of our data, before passing it on for Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

final_script_riya.ipynb is the Python script used for the project.
